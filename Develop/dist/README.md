  ## Description
  an app that allows the users to generate a README.md file template, that is automatically filled and formatted based on answers they give.

  ## Features
  By entering what parts a user wants to include in their README files, the user is able to efficiently create guides without having to sacrifice uniformity with their other repositories.

  ## Installation 
  Node.js, npm, npm 'fs', npm'inquirer'

  ## Usage
  navigate to the 'develop folder inside the terminal and run the command 'node index.js' From there follow the prompts until a message notifies a file has been created in the 'dist' folder. Once it has, navigate to the dist folder to find the newly created README.md file.
